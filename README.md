# List the things you added for points
Create an interactive fiction story with at least 8 knots
13 Loops [Bonus asked for more than 8]

Create at least one major choice that the player can make
You can choose to never go into the cavern which immediately ends the game

Reflect that choice back to the player
It will then tell the player they went home and decided to cave dive another day

Include at least one loop
If you decide to choose a different creature to summon before you enter the cave the game will allow you to rechoose until you are satisfied with your choice

[+1] Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item
You can pick up torches which will allow for new areas to be explored further

[+1] Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa)
If you find the chest that is unlocked it will increase you health to allow you to fight the mimc
